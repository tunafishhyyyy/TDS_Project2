# Multi-Step Task Execution Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Multi-step tasks not being executed**: The original `WebScrapingWorkflow` only generated a plan but didn't actually execute the scraping, data cleaning, plotting, and analysis steps.

2. **Insufficient logging**: The logging didn't provide enough detail about what's happening during execution.

3. **Missing LLM attribute error**: The orchestrator didn't have an `llm` attribute for workflow detection.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. New MultiStepWebScrapingWorkflow

Created a new workflow class that actually executes multi-step tasks:

- **Location**: `chains/workflows.py` - `MultiStepWebScrapingWorkflow`
- **Features**:
  - Extracts URLs from task descriptions
  - Generates executable Python code
  - Safely executes code blocks
  - Captures output variables
  - Provides detailed execution results

### 2. Enhanced Logging

Improved logging throughout the application:

- **File logging**: Added file handler to `app.log`
- **Workflow detection**: Enhanced logging for workflow detection process
- **Execution tracking**: Added detailed logging for workflow execution
- **Error handling**: Enhanced error logging with tracebacks

### 3. Fixed LLM Attribute Issue

Updated `AdvancedWorkflowOrchestrator`:

- **LLM initialization**: Added proper LLM initialization in constructor
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when LLM is not available
- **Workflow registration**: Added `multi_step_web_scraping` to available workflows

### 4. Enhanced Workflow Detection

Updated workflow detection to properly identify multi-step tasks:

- **LLM detection**: Enhanced prompt to distinguish between simple and multi-step web scraping
- **Fallback detection**: Updated keyword-based detection to identify multi-step tasks
- **Validation**: Added proper validation for new workflow types

## Key Changes

### chains/workflows.py
```python
class MultiStepWebScrapingWorkflow(BaseWorkflow):
    """Enhanced workflow for multi-step web scraping tasks with actual execution"""
    
    async def execute(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Extract URL from task description
        # Generate executable code
        # Execute code blocks safely
        # Return detailed results
```

### main.py
```python
# Enhanced logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(),
        logging.FileHandler('app.log')
    ]
)

# Enhanced workflow detection
async def detect_workflow_type_llm(task_description: str, default_workflow: str = "data_analysis") -> str:
    # Updated to include multi_step_web_scraping
    # Enhanced prompts for better detection
```

## Testing

Created multiple test scripts to verify the fixes:

### Basic Test
```bash
python test_multi_step_workflow.py
```

### Improved Test with Dependency Checking
```bash
python test_improved_workflow.py
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```

These scripts test the multi-step workflow with the questions.txt file and provide detailed output about:
- Dependency availability
- Scraping plan generation
- Code execution results
- Output variables captured
- Steps executed

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes, when you submit the questions.txt file:

1. **Workflow Detection**: The system will detect `multi_step_web_scraping` workflow
2. **Code Generation**: The LLM will generate executable Python code with dynamic column handling
3. **Execution**: The code will be safely executed with proper error handling and data inspection
4. **Results**: You'll get actual results including:
   - Scraped data from Wikipedia
   - Cleaned and processed data
   - Visualizations (bar charts)
   - Answers to specific questions (5th ranked country, total GDP)

### Key Improvements in Latest Version:
- **Generic Approach**: Code works with any type of data, not just GDP-specific
- **Dynamic Column Detection**: Code inspects actual data structure before processing
- **Robust Error Handling**: Better handling of missing columns and data issues
- **Debug Output**: Detailed logging of data processing steps
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple strategies for finding numeric data columns
- **Flexible Data Processing**: Handles various data formats and structures automatically

## Logging Improvements

The enhanced logging will now show:
- Detailed workflow detection process
- Step-by-step execution progress
- Code generation and execution results
- Error details with full tracebacks
- Available workflows and their status
