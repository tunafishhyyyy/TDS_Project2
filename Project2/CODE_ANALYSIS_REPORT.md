# Code Analysis Report - TDS Project2

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Line Width Violations (PEP 8 Standard: 79 characters)

**Files with violations:**
- `chains/web_scraping_steps.py`: 50+ lines over 79 characters
- `main.py`: 30+ lines over 79 characters  
- `chains/workflows.py`: 20+ lines over 79 characters

**Standard Recommendation:** PEP 8 specifies maximum line length of 79 characters for better readability and compatibility with tools.

### 2. Dead Code Identified

**Empty implementations found:**
- Multiple `pass` statements in exception handlers that should have proper logging
- Incomplete method implementations that break functionality

### 3. Overly Specific Code

**Domain-specific hardcoded logic found in `web_scraping_steps.py`:**

1. **Financial data logic** - hardcoded for movies/GDP data
2. **Sports data logic** - specific to cricket statistics  
3. **Health data logic** - hardcoded for COVID statistics
4. **Entertainment data logic** - specific to movie ratings

**Problems with current approach:**
- Violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Not scalable for new domains
- Maintenance nightmare
- Hard to test individual components

### 4. Missing Error Handling

Several methods have empty `except:` blocks with just `pass` statements, which hide errors and make debugging difficult.

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Line Width - Apply Black Formatter
```bash
# Install black formatter
pip install black

# Format all Python files
black . --line-length=79
```

### 2. Replace Domain-Specific Logic with Generic LLM-Based Approach

Instead of hardcoded domain logic, use a single LLM-based analyzer:

```python
def _analyze_data_with_llm(self, data_clean, analysis_col: str, name_col: str, task_description: str) -> dict:
    """Generic LLM-based data analysis replacing all domain-specific methods"""
    # Single method that handles all data types intelligently
```

### 3. Remove Dead Code

Remove all empty `pass` statements and replace with proper error handling:

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in {method_name}: {str(e)}")
    return fallback_value
```

### 4. Implement Configuration-Driven Approach

Instead of hardcoded keywords, use configuration files:

```python
# data_analysis_config.json
{
    "financial_indicators": ["gross", "revenue", "gdp", "billion"],
    "sports_indicators": ["runs", "average", "cricket", "goals"],
    "health_indicators": ["cases", "deaths", "covid", "mortality"]
}
```

## Priority Fixes

1. **High Priority**: Fix line width violations (affects readability)
2. **High Priority**: Remove dead code (affects functionality)  
3. **Medium Priority**: Replace domain-specific logic with generic approach
4. **Low Priority**: Add proper logging and error handling

## Tools to Help

1. **Black** - Auto-format code to PEP 8 standards
2. **Flake8** - Lint code for style violations
3. **PyLint** - Comprehensive code analysis
4. **Pre-commit hooks** - Prevent future violations

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these fixes?
