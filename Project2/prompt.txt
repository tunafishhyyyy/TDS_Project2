1. I think #6 is not handled correctly, the
Workflows like WikipediaScrapingWorkflow, LegalDataAnalysisWorkflow are
too specific and should be generalized to DataAnalysisWorkflow or similar. 
Present: There are specific workflows (WikipediaScrapingWorkflow, LegalDataAnalysisWorkflow).
Missing: Generalized workflows (e.g., DataAnalysisWorkflow) for broader use cases.
Action: Refactor or add generalized workflows, and allow easy extension.

2. No Backward compatibility endpoint Needed - not needed => single_file": "/api/single-file/ (POST - backward compatibility) 
   also remove the related code if present in test_upload.html and other test scripts.

3. similar "status": "/api/tasks/{task_id}/status (GET)" is also not needed, response should be synchronous.
   Also remove the related code if present in test_upload.html and other test scripts.  

4. following parameters will not be used in the API endpoint:
    workflow_type: Optional[str] = Form("data_analysis"),
    business_context: Optional[str] = Form(None),
    sync_processing: Optional[bool] = Form(False, description="Process synchronously if True")

   Instead, the endpoint will accept:
   - "questions.txt" as a required file
   - Optional additional files like "image.png", "data.csv"
    task_description: this will be nothing but the content of questions.txt file.
    the response always needs to be synchronous, so no need for sync_processing parameter.

5. there wont be andy JSON based requests so /api/analyze this Legacy endpoint for JSON-based requests is not needed.
   Also remove the related code if present in test_upload.html and other test scripts.
