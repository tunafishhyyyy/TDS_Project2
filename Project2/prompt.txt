== Notes ==
* While running in Agent mode Pls do not run the commands on this machine directly the actual python code and API server runs inside a Docker container, Direct commands will not work.
* No need to create test scripts unless its specifically mentioned in the context
* No need to create Instruction md files unless its specifically mentioned in the context
* These are not the final questions I be evaluated on. These examples are indicative.
  so data scraping needs to be generic and prompts as well. Make data scraping generic and prompts generic. The scraping logic and prompts
  should work for any table, not just any one use case.
